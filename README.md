Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard for Adidas
This Power BI project provides an interactive, data-driven analysis of Adidas sales performance, offering detailed insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance. With a focus on uncovering actionable insights, I designed this dashboard to help stakeholders understand key performance metrics and make data-informed decisions.
Key Features:
Sales Performance Overview: A comprehensive view of sales by region, product category, and time period, allowing for an in-depth understanding of overall trends and seasonal patterns.
Customer Demographics: Insightful visualizations into customer segments and purchasing behaviors to highlight target markets and potential growth areas.
Top-Performing Products: Identification of the best-selling products and underperforming categories, enabling effective inventory and promotional planning.
Skills Applied: Leveraging advanced DAX formulas, data modeling, and transformation techniques, I created dynamic visuals and filters to allow users to explore the data intuitively. This project demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into meaningful insights, ensuring business relevance and strategic decision support.
Here Iâ€™m using area chart, Filed map, clustered bar chart, Donut chart, Card, Slicer.
